# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a project from the [Udemy.com](http://www.udemy.com) course [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/).

In this project, I am manipulating the Document Object Model using plain JavaScript.
Each click of a square in the Tic-Tac-Toe box will cycle from "X" to "O" then back to a blank square. 
Clicking the "Restart!" button will reset all the squares to become blank. 

There are no other requirements for this project and there is no notification if a row of "X"'s or "O"'s are achieved.
